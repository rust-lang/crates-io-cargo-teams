# Team Policies

This documents two policies, 1) observing a team meeting, and 2) joining the team.

## Team composition

This document aims to formalize the procedures for getting membership in the Rust
community team.

------

In general, we should encourage participation from community members who are not part of the team,
as outlined in the observer policy (below).

In some cases such participating members may have enough involvement that we feel it advatageous to
include them in the team. Some reasons for doing this may be:

 - Recognition: If someone is especially active in this space, it is worth adding them to the team to recognize them.
 - "Officializing": For some tasks, like talking with other companies, it is useful to be able to say you are "X of the Rust Community Team"

Most community team activities should be designed such that as much as possible, team membership is not required.

To add someone as a member, they need to be nominated by an existing member on the private community team mailing list.
Team members can voice approval/objections, and come to consensus on the topic. Consensus is judged by the community team lead.
In general for team additions this will skew towards there being unanimous approval with at worst minor concerns.

(NOTE: With the advent of subteams this may include relevant subteam leaders for judging consensus)

Voluntarily leaving the team can be done by contacting the community team lead or mailing list. If you wish to re-join
afterwards you will have to be nominated again.

## Observer policy

This document aims to formalize our meeting structure with respect to external observers and participants.

-----

Meetings are open by default. Specific topics may require a more closed video meeting or a meeting
in a private channel, but in general we should hold our meetings in public.

Non-team folks can drop by and take part in discussions if they wish, however they may be asked to
wait till later to say their bit in case it's not the topic being discussed. This puts them at the same level as
team members during an open team meeting. We can tweak this on a per case
basis; if we're running out of time and need team feedback we can ask them to wait till later
even if on topic.

If someone not from the team wishes to lead or participate in an agenda item, they may comment on
the agenda issue or ask a team member to set it up for them. We try to give priority to agenda items
involving such guests, since they may not be able to make it for other meetings.

If a member has an agenda item you're leading in a meeting, a couple days before the meeting they
should try to consider if there are non-team members you'd want to be there, and invite them if so
(mentioning that they have been invited in the issue).

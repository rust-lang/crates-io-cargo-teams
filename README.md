# crates-io-team
the home of the crates io team

The crates.io team is a set of people who help direct and focus the
development and maintenance of crates.io as a service.

## Meetings

All are welcome to join the team's weekly open meetings that happen in the
#infra/crates.io channel on Discord on Thursdays at 4pm UTC/8pm ET. You can
get specific details on a meeting by looking at issues tagged [`agenda`] on
this repo's issue tracker.

At the end of each meeting, the notetaker will post notes as a comment on the
issue and close it.

[`agenda`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/crates-io-team/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aagenda 

Occasionally, (~monthly) the team will have a video call to discuss topics that
require deeper conversation. Participation requires an invite, but don't hesistate
to ask for one. These meetings will be recorded and posted to YouTube, if all
participating folks consent.

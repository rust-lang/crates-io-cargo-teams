# Summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

# Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

# Impact on users of cargo

This section should describe how this change affects users of Cargo. If this RFC
only affects crates.io, or if this RFC does not impact users, this section can
be omitted. This should be treated similarly to a "Guide-level explanation".
This generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.
- Explaining how the feature can be configured

# Impact on users of crates.io

This section should describe how this change affects users of crates.io. If this
RFC only affects Cargo, or if this RFC does not impact users, this section can
be omitted. This should be treated similarly to a "Guide-level explanation".
This generally means:

- How will users interact with or be able to observe this change?
- If applicable, what public API endpoints are available?
- If applicable, what new UI is added?

# Impact on cargo

This section should describe, in detail, the changes required to Cargo to
support this change. This includes details required for implementation, or
details that affect the Cargo team, but not users of Cargo. If this RFC only
affects crates.io, this section can be deleted.

# Impact on crates.io

This section should describe, in detail, the changes required to Cargo to
support this change. This includes details required for implementation, or
details that affect the Cargo team, but not users of Cargo. If this RFC only
affects cargo, this section can be deleted. If the impact on both Cargo and
crates.io is the same, this can be merged with the previous section.

# Drawbacks

Why should we not do this?

# Rationale and alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
